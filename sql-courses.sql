That is, the \'race condition (a type of deadlock) caused the blackout The error occurred because two programs in the XA/2I system simultaneously wrote and accessed the same data structure. The error corrupted the data structure, which in turn the alarm process into an infinite and even an alarm processing failure was not notified. The alarm queue increased indefinitely, and all available memory was consumed after 30 minutes At that time, the main server was down. A failover mechanism was activated, and the backup server became the main server However, the backup server also failed because it couldn\'t handle the infinitely increasing queue. This incident is a representative case of software causing a fatal error resulting in tremendous damage to real life, because the software was developed without a proper understanding of basic software technologies such as the data structure and algorithm. data structure, which is a way of structurally expressing data in programming, presents a way to conveniently access data and store or organize them for the purpose of changing the data structure. An algorithm refers to a well-defined calculation process to output after solving the problem by receiving a certain value: For example, let\'s consider a case in which a house is built with blocks. We can build the best only when we select and stack the most appropriate block for a given design, such as material, color, and shape among several blocks, depending on the structure or shape of the house. However, What is far more important than this is that we have to properly understand the materials and characteristics of each block and the various utilization methods If we don\'t use the blocks in the right place, a shoddy and faulty construction is inevitable when the house is completed. The data structure and algorithm are like these blocks Various basic technologies are available that pace with the development of information systems. Therefore, we can expect high-quality software that is optimal for a given environment, if we develop software by adopting and applying the most appropriate data structure and algorithm: The data structure is an important technique in terms of coding efficiency: An algorithm enables us to select more easily a data structure that can solve a given problem, and also allows us to handle a given problem efficiently, considering the processing time and storage location: put loop, house rapid keep','',2,NULL,NULL,'2025-04-18 17:10:24','2025-04-18 17:10:24'),(94,'26','App\\Models\\Section','Text','A data structure is a method of storing data in the memory device of a computer: It defines data systematically so that various data can be efficiently expressed and utilized, considering the characteristics and usages of data.','',1,NULL,NULL,'2025-04-18 17:10:24','2025-04-18 17:10:24'),(95,'27','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'<Table 8  Classification of data structures',NULL,'680287976a8f8.png','/storage/tables/680287976a8f8.png','2025-04-18 17:10:24','2025-04-18 17:10:47'),(96,'27','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'<Table 9  Comparison of sequential data structures and linked data structures',NULL,'68028797a1a6b.png','/storage/tables/68028797a1a6b.png','2025-04-18 17:10:24','2025-04-18 17:10:47'),(97,'27','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'',NULL,'68028797e62d0.png','/storage/tables/68028797e62d0.png','2025-04-18 17:10:24','2025-04-18 17:10:47'),(98,'27','App\\Models\\Section','Figures',NULL,'[Figure 1] Classification of the data structure',NULL,'680287981c048.png','/storage/figures/680287981c048.png','2025-04-18 17:10:24','2025-04-18 17:10:48'),(99,'27','App\\Models\\Section','Text','The data structure can be broadly divided into linear and non-linear structures.

Software design faults are sometimes eliminated while repeating tests such as boundary value analysis.

However exception handling for integer-type conversion errors was not fully reflected in the design, causing overflow: As a result, altitude and velocity information was not sent to the central control computer When a failure occurred in one SRI-2, the redundant SRI-1 should have been activated. However, as the architecture was designed in this way, There could be no effect due to an input value error: Eventually, Ariane 5 deviated from its course ad exploded because its engine nozzle angle and thrust could not be controlled. According to the eventual findings, three exceptions out of seven items were omitted from Ariane 5 to achieve the SRIs maximum load target of 80%.

However, the reality is that those involved in software development are unable to pay sufficient attention to testing because it is difficult to perform their own fixed tasks only, and that few developers are actively interested in any other than unit testing: As development itself is conducted with insufficient personnel and resources for a shorter than the actual schedule, it is not easy to consider investing in testing: Testers who perform tasks sometimes know too little about testing: Testing is performed without an accurate understanding of the testing techniques Decision makers or managers do not fully recognize the importance of testing Even though test engineers with a sense of mission try to run testing properly, executives sometimes force them to testing without understanding its importance Source: Factors constraining software testing http:Ileungurutistory com/158] The reality is that the service operation team and the development team also perform testing tasks nternally in companies, except for conglomerates.

It is also rare to prove an anomaly by assigning functional dependency to each table, as we did when learning the theory of normalization Why, then, is SO important that we should leamn the theory of normalization and remember the theory of normalization? Learning and utilizing normalization for practical business can be summarized into two points The first is that those who learn the theory of normalization accurately can identify objects anc establish a relationship based on the idea of normalization, even though normalization is not performec according to the normalization procedure That is, even though data modeling is not performed according to the process of normalization, those whc perform data modeling are clearly aware of the theory and are naturally aware of functional dependency Therefore, perform data modeling that perspective. Conversely, those who do not know the concept of normalization frequently perform data modeling that goes against the first, second,, and thirc normalizations because lack the concept of normalization It can be understood that normalization utilized by so-called \"internalized inner forces\".

However, the transaction is internally composed of two update operations, ie changing the balance of account A and changing that of account B, respectively: What if this operation fails in the middle of processing, and the balance of account A has been changed while that of account B remains unchanged? If any operation fails, all operations relating to the account transfer task should be either performed normally as whole or returned to the original state prior to the operations. As explained previously, a set of operations that constitute a logical work unit is called a \'transaction\". The important here is that all operations of the transaction should be completely executed or returned to the original state before any transaction if an error occurs. What if the of the data shared between transactions cannot be controlled in a database system that executes several transactions simultaneously? For example, what happens if you transfer KRW 1,000 online from an account with a balance of KRW 1,000 and withdraw KRW 1,000 from a ATM at the same time? In reality, it is naturally impossible, because the database system controls these transactions As explained so far the database system provides a concurrency control method to secure the isolation of a transaction, which ensures that the transaction is not affected by the change made by another transaction at the same time. However if the level of transaction isolation is high, simultaneous access to the database (concurrency) becomes difficult and performance is negatively affected. Therefore, the isolation level should be selected appropriately by considering the nature of the transaction In fact, service failure occurs frequently in the field due to the problem with concurrency control including the case of the college course registration crisis that occurred due to the application of the isolation level of the banking system, which requires strict transaction isolation, to the course registration system: Therefore, the concept of transaction and concurrency control should be correctly understood to determine the \"appropriate\" level of the to be developed and transaction isolation thing update college system','',3,NULL,NULL,'2025-04-18 20:11:48','2025-04-18 20:11:48'),(1026,'375','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','A transaction is a set of several operations constituting a logical task unit, which converts a consistent state of the database to another consistent state.

It works by setting the semaphore value to \"wait\" when a process enters the critical section and changing the value to \"signal\" when the process exits the critical section: Another process checks the semaphore value and does not enter the critical section if the value isin the \"wait\" state, preventing multiple processes from simultaneously accessing the shared data being','',1,NULL,NULL,'2025-04-18 21:12:10','2025-04-18 21:12:10'),(1296,'349','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'(Table 5} Conditions Causing Deadlock',NULL,'6802c04444e85.png','/storage/tables/6802c04444e85.png','2025-04-18 21:12:10','2025-04-18 21:12:36'),(1297,'349','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'(Table 6) Ways to Solve Deadlock State',NULL,'6802c04452c42.png','/storage/tables/6802c04452c42.png','2025-04-18 21:12:10','2025-04-18 21:12:36'),(1298,'349','App\\Models\\Section','Text','In a multi-, programming environment, the processes compete with each other to use limited resources.

HTTP/I.I is the current version in use and is designed to be more reliable than HTTP/1.0. Like most standard application protocols, the HTTP protocol implements a request/response protocolthat is suitable for a client-server environment. Since web browsers, such as Microsoft\'s Interet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and web servers, such as Apache HTTP Server, implement the HTTP protocol, users generally have no difficulty using the web without fully knowing the HTTP protocol implementation. However, when developing an Internet application or a new application protocol, it is helpful to know text-based application layer protocols, such as HTTP, since they are design and implementation tools good The HTTP protocol uses a request/response protocol. The client sends a request message, in the form of <request method, URI, protocol version, MIME type information message  , to the server, and the server responds with a status line that includes protocol version, success or error code, MIME type server information, etc, to the client as a response message  Here, the current HTTP/I.1 version is mainly used The method, designated in Request-Line of an HTTP request message, specifies the HTTP protocol operation. Although RFC 2616 defines eight methods, can be extended as needed.

In an environment where managers working for a hypermarket can check inventory ad product information in realtime, place products on shelves in ways that reflect customer shopping behaviors and local characteristics, and collect customers\' purchasing histories in realtime, the answer to this question would be a resounding \'NO\'.

It also created the \'Starbucks Digital Network\' in partnership with Yahoo after noticing that visitors to its stores were regularly using its free WiFi service This network, through its content portal function, provides free Wall Street Joural articles for customers to read and free downloadable tunes iTunes for customers to enjoy: Furthermore, the company internally worked on its business process more efficient Now, Starbucks baristas no longer have to bend down when making coffee, while the total time spent waiting for the coffee to be made has been minimized and the time spent on making drinks has been reduced. To this end, the company formed the Lean Team to advise the company on benchmarking the lean manufacturing method pioneered by Toyota Motor Company: What\'s more, the company built a smart work environment with wireless technology that maximizes the work efficiency of its employees Within this smart work environment,, Starbucks employees can do their work in any store across the nation. This has resulted in about 25% longer store visiting times by the companys regional managers Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks said, \"Most of the cost savings _ come from new ways of operating our stores and new customer services\" .

In general, quality management consists of quality planning, quality control, and quality assurance. There is no significant difference in the overall composition, but the quality management of the actual project is somewhat different from that of the manufacturing industry: For example, if quality control in manufacturing is about product quality, quality control of project can be seen as process quality This is due to the fact that the working method differs depending o the process in which the result is generated: If the quality control of the manufacturing industry is to manage the defects of a number of products produced, the quality control of the project is to manage one or a few outputs system) without errors. Defect management for many products can be viewed as product quality management, and error management for a few outputs can be viewed as process quality management: In particular in an IT project, as the output is intangible, quality control for intermediate outputs should be carried out at each project stage (eg, analysis, design, execution, testing, deployment stage, etc) long (e.g , testing, deployment stage, etc ). Quality management activities for each project stage are carried out through techniques such as review, inspection, and walk-through, which are performed based on guidance from specialized quality management organizations (e.g , quality management team, quality assurance team, etc ). In particular, if enterprise-wide quality control is to lead to the quality control of individual projects, the company can receive guidance on enterprise quality standards through the PMO (Project Management Office) or check the quality level. If such diverse quality management is meticulously carried out according to a systematic procedure, quality cost can be minimized by satisfying the quality targets requested by customers (eg, the acquirer) at the end of the project. Another advantage is that Validation ad Verification of requirements can reduce Rework through clarification: This helps scope management by preventing omission of requirements, and schedule management by reducing wasted time.
