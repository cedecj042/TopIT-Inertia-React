That is, it is more effective to only run an integrity check once and check file alteration in real time whenever the file is executed or loaded into the memory to check whether the file has been tampered.

The two important concepts of SSL are connection and session: SSL connection: SSL connection refers to transport providing appropriate services A connection in SSL is a peer-to-peer relationship and is temporary, and all connections are associated with one session: SSL session: An SSL session refers to an association between a client and a server, To start a session, the handshake protocol should be used, which will be described below: A session defines cryptographic security parameters that are shared by multiple connections, which is used to avoid negotiating required new security parameters for each connection:','',1,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:03'),(401,'182','App\\Models\\Subsection','Tables',NULL,'<Table 38  Operation by phase of the SSL protocol',9,'67b50a3d4ed01.png','/storage/tables/67b50a3d4ed01.png','2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:25'),(402,'182','App\\Models\\Subsection','Figures',NULL,'[Figure 64] Composition of the SSL protocol',2,'67b50a3d5a190.png','/storage/figures/67b50a3d5a190.png','2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:25'),(403,'182','App\\Models\\Subsection','Figures',NULL,'[Figure 65] Operating procedure of the SSL protocol',8,'67b50a3d64838.png','/storage/figures/67b50a3d64838.png','2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:25'),(404,'182','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','Structure of the SSL protocol As shown in [Figure 64], SSL is composed of four protocols, including handshake, change cipher Spec, record and alert.','',1,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:03'),(405,'182','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','Type ot SSL protocols <Table 37  shows the functions by SSL protocol type.','',3,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:03'),(406,'182','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','Operating procedure of the SSL protocol [Figure 65] shows the main operating procedure of the SSL protocol, and <Table 38  shows the operating details of each phase.','',7,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:03'),(407,'183','App\\Models\\Subsection','Tables',NULL,'<Table 39  Checking SSL application',2,'67b50a3d6d4c0.png','/storage/tables/67b50a3d6d4c0.png','2025-02-18 22:31:03','2025-02-18 22:31:25'),(408,'183','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','Installing an SSL certiticate in the server An SSL certificate should be installed in the web server to apply SSL.

As such, many unknowingly made normalization violations are found in many projects. Besides artificial denormalization, there are many models that are not normalized without forecasting the result Data integrity is lost because such a model is to table creation and then to the operating environment. As a result, the quality of the business data is deteriorated: Therefore, it should be remembered that it is also used as a tool to verify the completeness of the data model that has been designed based on the theory of normalization they applied','',2,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:07','2025-02-18 22:31:07'),(596,'284','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','(Example) When inserting the information (Department name \'Management information\" , Department office \"Management Building\") into the table in <Table 25  .

However, the transaction is internally composed of two update operations, ie changing the balance of account A and changing that of account B, respectively: What if this operation fails in the middle of processing, and the balance of account A has been changed while that of account B remains unchanged? If any operation fails, all operations relating to the account transfer task should be either performed normally as whole or returned to the original state prior to the operations. As explained previously, a set of operations that constitute a logical work unit is called a \'transaction\". The important here is that all operations of the transaction should be completely executed or returned to the original state before any transaction if an error occurs. What if the of the data shared between transactions cannot be controlled in a database system that executes several transactions simultaneously? For example, what happens if you transfer KRW 1,000 online from an account with a balance of KRW 1,000 and withdraw KRW 1,000 from a ATM at the same time? In reality, it is naturally impossible, because the database system controls these transactions As explained so far the database system provides a concurrency control method to secure the isolation of a transaction, which ensures that the transaction is not affected by the change made by another transaction at the same time. However if the level of transaction isolation is high, simultaneous access to the database (concurrency) becomes difficult and performance is negatively affected. Therefore, the isolation level should be selected appropriately by considering the nature of the transaction In fact, service failure occurs frequently in the field due to the problem with concurrency control including the case of the college course registration crisis that occurred due to the application of the isolation level of the banking system, which requires strict transaction isolation, to the course registration system: Therefore, the concept of transaction and concurrency control should be correctly understood to determine the \"appropriate\" level of the to be developed and transaction isolation thing update college system','',3,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:09','2025-02-18 22:31:09'),(792,'406','App\\Models\\Subsection','Text','A transaction is a set of several operations constituting a logical task unit, which converts a consistent state of the database to another consistent state.

That is, the \'race condition (a type of deadlock) caused the blackout The error occurred because two programs in the XA/2I system simultaneously wrote and accessed the same data structure. The error corrupted the data structure, which in turn the alarm process into an infinite and even an alarm processing failure was not notified. The alarm queue increased indefinitely, and all available memory was consumed after 30 minutes At that time, the main server was down. A failover mechanism was activated, and the backup server became the main server However, the backup server also failed because it couldn\'t handle the infinitely increasing queue. This incident is a representative case of software causing a fatal error resulting in tremendous damage to real life, because the software was developed without a proper understanding of basic software technologies such as the data structure and algorithm. data structure, which is a way of structurally expressing data in programming, presents a way to conveniently access data and store or organize them for the purpose of changing the data structure. An algorithm refers to a well-defined calculation process to output after solving the problem by receiving a certain value: For example, let\'s consider a case in which a house is built with blocks. We can build the best only when we select and stack the most appropriate block for a given design, such as material, color, and shape among several blocks, depending on the structure or shape of the house. However, What is far more important than this is that we have to properly understand the materials and characteristics of each block and the various utilization methods If we don\'t use the blocks in the right place, a shoddy and faulty construction is inevitable when the house is completed. The data structure and algorithm are like these blocks Various basic technologies are available that pace with the development of information systems. Therefore, we can expect high-quality software that is optimal for a given environment, if we develop software by adopting and applying the most appropriate data structure and algorithm: The data structure is an important technique in terms of coding efficiency: An algorithm enables us to select more easily a data structure that can solve a given problem, and also allows us to handle a given problem efficiently, considering the processing time and storage location: put loop, house rapid keep','',3,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:14','2025-02-18 22:31:14'),(969,'312','App\\Models\\Section','Text','A data structure is a method of storing data in the memory device of a computer: It defines data systematically so that various data can be efficiently expressed and utilized, considering the characteristics and usages of data.','',1,NULL,NULL,'2025-02-18 22:31:14','2025-02-18 22:31:14'),(970,'313','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'<Table 9  Comparison of sequential data structures and linked data structures',4,'67b50a4539652.png','/storage/tables/67b50a4539652.png','2025-02-18 22:31:14','2025-02-18 22:31:33'),(971,'313','App\\Models\\Section','Tables',NULL,'',4,'67b50a45452ef.png','/storage/tables/67b50a45452ef.png','2025-02-18 22:31:14','2025-02-18 22:31:33'),(972,'313','App\\Models\\Section','Figures',NULL,'[Figure 1] Classification of the data structure',3,'67b50a454d296.png','/storage/figures/67b50a454d296.png','2025-02-18 22:31:14','2025-02-18 22:31:33'),(973,'313','App\\Models\\Section','Text','The data structure can be broadly divided into linear and non-linear structures.

The example below is a representative ex- ample of deductive indirect reasoning (Second premise) Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning invented by Francis Bacon in 1620. According to Bacon, it refers to a method of making guesses or hypotheses and principles from empirical facts and judging truth/falsehood with empirical facts  In other words, it is a method of deriving a general principle from several concrete facts. The example below is a representative example of inductive reasoning: Socrates is dead. (Concrete fact) Therefore, a man is mortal.

In order to effectively persuade stakeholders, there is mor to be needed than logical explanation. In some cases, it is necessary to explain or verify an established hypothesis using a statistical method, and the two mutually exclusive statements used in this case are the null hypothesis and the alternative hypoth- esis.
